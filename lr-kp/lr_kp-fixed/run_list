#started with 50 resources, went up to 500k resources and made it to longer updates
#population still died off so turned off death and added 10 times more resources (previous stuff)
#then, they only got to 1400 generations, so now we are trying for more. 
#they filled up the population at around 120 updates so we are doing it every 125
#change birth method to 4 which is mass action like a flask
